## Proper Need Statement/Analysis
**Problem Statement**: The current barrier-of-entry for autonomous mobile robotics is too high.

### Target Audience
* Professor Soo Jeon - MTE544, university-level course
* Enthusiasts
* Parents buying their first robot for their kid
* High school robotics teams
* Elementary school robotics teams
* Robotics researchers


### Core Values 
* Forwards compatible with phone upgrades
* Plug and play option
* Open source: hardware, robot software, firmware
* Cheaper or better than the industry standard
  * Researcher: Turtlebot
  * Elemetary / high school: Lego mindstorms
  * Enthusiasts: Jetbot
* Small and light (fits in backpack)

### User Experience
* App creates framework to ingest sensor data into user model and output hardware actions
* User supplies their own model and plan
* There will be an API for users to control the hardware
* Examples and default model will exist for education

### Milestones
* 


### Hardware
* TZ wants decentalized hardware, specifically for the motors (idea: [link](https://cadenkraft.com/ironless-cycloidal-planetary-actuator/))
* NL proposes specifying a standard motor configuration 


### Software
