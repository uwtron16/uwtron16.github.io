## Individual Work

**Kai (09/20):** Worked on the [Market Research](https://uwtron16.github.io/blog/marketresearch/), compiling key existing solutions in the space and their characteristics. This serves to further justify/reinforce the needs indentified in the [Need Analysis](https://uwtron16.github.io/blog/need-analysis/), as well as generally understanding the current market for this product better. Through this research, we were able to confirm the validity of our initial need and identify an appropriate market segment for us; we believe that we can build a cheaper, more capable AMR that is can both be educational for schooling purposes and useful as a development platform for researchers.

## Group Work

#### Sept 22 work session
The team convened on September 22 to prepare the [Criteria, Constraints, Objectives](https://uwtron16.github.io/blog/criteria/) table, as well as discuss/research some design/implementation aspects of the project.

**Kai:** 
- Worked on setting the cost criteria based on the market research
- Worked on discussing software functionality criteria 
- Contributed to discussions on desired user interface/API for software, focusing on how to abstract a low-complexity API for education purposes while exposing enough functionality for researchers to use

**Thomason:**
- Worked on open-source criteria, weight, mobility, modularity criteria
- Worked on discussing software functionality criteria and interface/API discussions
- Discussed app implementation around Apple guardrails and possible web-app/WASM implementation

**Anders:**
- Worked on software functionality, durability, cycle time criteria
- Worked on discussions around interface/API discussions, research around Apple APIs and guardrails
- Discussed app implementation around Apple guardrails and possible web-app/WASM implementation

**Olivia:**
- Worked on HW functionality, durability, cycle time criteria 
- Discussed WiFi/Bluetooth communication protocols for hardware-software interface
- Contributed to hardware-software interface discussions and end-goal discussions

**Nathan:**
- Worked on HW functionality, durability, cycle time criteria 
- Discussed project end goals and desired completed prodct
- Discussed WiFi/Bluetooth communication protocols
